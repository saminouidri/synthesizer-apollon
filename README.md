## What is Apollon's Synthesizer?

The idea was to develop a music application in the form of a virtual instrument, combining the functionalities of a recording software
as well as an instrument. The user would have the freedom to play a variety
a variety of instruments using a MIDI keyboard, and would be able to record the pieces played, play them back
in parallel with other pieces to enable the production of a musical composition
with multiple instruments and motifs.

The virtual instruments incorporates the functionalities of a sampler, and a synthesizer. Once the user loads a sample library, he or she can play the instrument using an external USB MIDI keyboard.
The user can also use the synthesizer and play it with said keyboard. The application offers many options to modulate the signal to one's liking, enabling the user to reproduce the soft timber of a rhodes piano with a sine wave for example, 
or the harsh and punchy mid-frequency grit of a typical electro synth with a square wave.
